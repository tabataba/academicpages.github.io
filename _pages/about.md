Until recently I was a postdoctoral research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Lab, working on understanding the atmosphere dynamics of Jupiter. This year, my wife and I moved to Seattle, WA and I am looking for a job as a data scientist / research scientist.

Research interests:
-----
Over the last year I have immersed myself in data science and machine learning applications including biological-inspired neural network structures and cell data with researchers at the University of Washington.

Otherwise my interests include any planet with an atmosphere. I have been working on planetary atmosphere dynamics, getting into the vortex dynamics on Jupiter. I'm also interested in atmospheric macroturbulence, mechanical energy budgets, and equatorial waves. I used to work on the detectability of biomarker molecules on exoplanets using photochemical models.

Education:
-----
  * DPhil in Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics, University of Oxford, 2017
  * M.Sc. in Physics, Technische Universität Berlin, 2013
  * B.Sc. in Physics, Technische Universität Berlin, 2011
