About me
======
I am a postdoc at JPL, currently working on the atmosphere dynamics of Jupiter. I am interested in any planet with an atmosphere.

Research interests
------
* Planetary atmosphere dynamics, radiative transfer, photochemistry

* Jupiter, polar vortices, vortex crystals, mesoscale waves

* Geophysical fluid dynamics, planetary circulation regimes, super-rotation, equatorial waves

* Atmospheric macroturbulence, Lorenz energy cycle, spectral energy flux

* Exoplanet habitability, detectability of biomarkers
