title: "Polar vortices on Jupiter"
excerpt: "Patterns of polar cyclones are located about the poles on Jupiter. How are they generated? Why are they stable? Why don't they merge? I'm currently trying to characterize the long-term behavior of this phenomenon and model their generation and stability mechanisms.<br/><img src='https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/largesize/PIA22335_hires.jpg'> Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM"
